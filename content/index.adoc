== Add the Chart Repository for WildFly

The `wildfly` Helm chart can be installed from the chart repository at https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-charts[]:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add wildfly https://docs.wildfly.org/wildfly-charts/
helm search repo wildfly
----

.Compatibility with WildFly S2I images
[NOTE]
====

The `2.x` Helm Chart for WildFly relies on the https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i/[new source-to-image (S2I) from WildFly] that is available at https://quay.io/repository/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk11[quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-s2i-jdk11]. It is not compatible with the legacy S2I image at https://quay.io/repository/wildfly/wildfly-centos7[quay.io/wildfly/wildfly-centos7].

You can continue to use the `1.x` Helm Chart for WildFly with the legacy S2I images by specifying a `version` when you install with `helm`. For example, to use the latest `1.x` release of the Helm Chart, you can use:

[source,bash]
----
helm install my-legacy-app -f app.yaml wildfly/wildfly --version ^1.x
----

== Update the Chart Repository for WildFly

To ensure that you are using the latest Helm Chart to build and deploy your application images, you need to update the `wildfly` chart by running the command:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo update
----

== Install a Helm Release

We can build and deploy the https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/tree/main/helloworld[helloworld quickstart] with this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildfly/quickstart/main/helloworld/charts/helm.yaml[example file]:

[source,bash]
----
helm install helloworld \
    -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wildfly/quickstart/main/helloworld/charts/helm.yaml \
    wildfly/wildfly
----

When this command is executed, it will output information about the installed Helm release:

[source,bash]
----
NAME: helloworld
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Sep 20 12:29:06 2023
NAMESPACE: jmesnil1-dev
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Your WildFly application is building! To follow the build, run:

$ oc get build -w

Note that your Deployment will report "ErrImagePull" and "ImagePullBackOff" until the build is complete. Once the build is complete, your image will be automatically rolled out.

To follow the deployment of your application, run:

$ oc get deployment helloworld -w
