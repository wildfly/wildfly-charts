# Helm Chart for WildFly

A Helm chart for building and deploying a [WildFly](https://www.wildfly.org) application on OpenShift.

# Overview

The build and deploy steps are configured in separate `build` and `deploy` values.

The input of the `build` step is a Git repository that contains the application code and the output is an `ImageStreamTag` resource that contains the built application image.

The input of the `deploy` step is an `ImageStreamTag` resource that contains the built application image and the output is a `DeploymentConfig` and related resources to access the application from inside and outside OpenShift.

To be able to install a Helm release with that chart, you must be able to provide a valid application image.

## Build an Application Image from Source

If the application image must be built from source, the minimal configuration is:

```yaml
build:
  uri: <git repository URL of your application>
```

The `build` step will use OpenShift `BuildConfig` to build an application image from this Git repository.

## Pull an existing Application Image

If your application image already exists, you can skip the `build` step and directly deploy your application image.
In that case, the minimal configuration is:

```yaml
image:
  name: <name of the application image. e.g. "quay.io/example.org/my-app">
  tag: <tag of the applicication image. e.g. "1.3" (defaults to "latest")>
build:
  enabled: false
```

## Prerequisites
Below are prerequisites that may apply to your use case.

### Pull Secret
You will need to create a pull secret if you need to pull an image from an external registry that requires authentication. Use the following command as a reference to create your pull secret:
```bash
oc create secret docker-registry my-pull-secret --docker-server=$REGISTRY_URL --docker-username=$USERNAME --docker-password=$PASSWORD --docker-email=$EMAIL
```

You can use this secret by passing `--set build.pullSecret=my-pull-secret` to `helm install`, or you can configure this in a values file:

```yaml
build:
  pullSecret: my-pull-secret
```

### Push Secret

You will need to create a push secret if you want to push your image to an external registry. Use the following command as a reference to create your push secret:

```bash
oc create secret docker-registry my-push-secret --docker-server=$SERVER_URL --docker-username=$USERNAME --docker-password=$PASSWORD --docker-email=$EMAIL
```

You can use this secret by passing `--set build.output.pushSecret=my-push-secret` and `--set build.output.kind=DockerImage`, or you can configure these in a values file:

```yaml
build:
  output:
    kind: DockerImage
    pushSecret: my-push-secret
```

## Application Image

The configuration for the image that is built and deployed is configured in a `image` section.

| Value | Description | Default | Additional Information |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `image.name` | Name of the image you want to build/deploy | Defaults to the Helm release name. | The chart will create/reference an [ImageStream](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html) based on this value. |
| `image.tag` | Tag that you want to build/deploy | `latest` | The chart will create/reference an [ImageStreamTag](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html#images-using-imagestream-tags_image-streams-managing) based on the name provided |
